# Updates (to new gems)

Jekyll 4.0 comes with some major changes, notably:

  * Our `link` tag now comes with the `relative_url` filter incorporated into it.
    You should no longer prepend `{{ site.baseurl }}` to `{% link foo.md %}`
    For further details: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/6727

  * Our `post_url` tag now comes with the `relative_url` filter incorporated into it.
    You shouldn't prepend `{{ site.baseurl }}` to `{% post_url 2019-03-27-hello %}`
    For further details: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/7589

  * Support for deprecated configuration options has been removed. We will no longer
    output a warning and gracefully assign their values to the newer counterparts
    internally.


---------------

Ruby Sass has reached end-of-life and should no longer be used.

* If you use Sass as a command-line tool, we recommend using Dart Sass, the new
  primary implementation: https://sass-lang.com/install

* If you use Sass as a plug-in for a Ruby web framework, we recommend using the
  sassc gem: https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby#readme

* For more details, please refer to the Sass blog:
